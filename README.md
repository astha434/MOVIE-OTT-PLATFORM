## Getting Started
 

#### Design the User Interface (UI) with HTML/CSS:

Create the layout of the platform using HTML.
Use CSS to style the platform, ensuring a clean and responsive design across different devices.
Design movie browsing sections like featured, trending, or categories.

#### Develop Core Functionality with JavaScript:
 
Implement JavaScript to add interactivity, such as searching, filtering, and displaying movie details.
Create event listeners for user actions like clicking on movies or navigation buttons.

#### Integrate First Architecture Database:

Set up a database using the First Architecture Database to store and manage movie data.
Connect the platform to the database to fetch and display the list of movies dynamically.
Ensure the platform can retrieve movie information like titles, descriptions, and streaming links.

#### Enable Free Movie Streaming:

Provide links or embed video players for users to stream movies.
Ensure that the video player offers basic controls like play, pause, and fullscreen.

#### Test the Platform:

Test the platform across multiple devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and smooth functionality.
Debug any issues related to user interaction or data fetching
